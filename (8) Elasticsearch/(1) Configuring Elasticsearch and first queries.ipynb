    "+ First do the first step that appear on this webpage: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/7.17/docker.html\n",
    "+ Check that you can enter here (elasticsearch working): http://localhost:9200/ and here (kibana working): http://localhost:5601/ \n",
    "+ enter in http://localhost:5601/app/home#/ and go to **Upload a file** it is in the main page.\n",
    "+ Upload file in my case I upload this: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/tag-genome-2021/ In particular this part is the important one: raw/metadata.json \n",
    "+ Put a name to the index uploaded, in my case is call: **movie_rating**\n",
    "+ After is uploaded/imported, go to management > dev tool (you access through the left panel)\n",

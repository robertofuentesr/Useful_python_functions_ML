# Useful_python_functions_ML
Here I will upload codes to analyse data using typical and useful functions in Python.
Using the simplest possible code we will understand how to use these functions.

More than giving a lengthy explanation we are going to use these various functions,
in a simple situation seeing empirically their intrinsic value.

Some of the functions already explained are: 
* train_test_split
* KNNImputer
* ColumnTransformer
* RandomizedSearchCV
* RandomForestClassifier

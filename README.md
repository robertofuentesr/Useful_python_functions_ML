# Useful_python_functions_ML
Here I will upload codes to analyse data using typical and useful functions in Python.
Using the simplest possible code we will understand how to use these functions.

More than giving a lengthy explanation we are going to use these various functions,
in a simple situation seeing empirically their intrinsic value.

Some of the functions already explained are: 
* train_test_split
* Pipeline
* KNNImputer
* ColumnTransformer
* Cross-validation
* RandomizedSearchCV
* RandomForestClassifier
* ROC and AUC (working with predict_proba)
* Confusion_matrix
* SHAP and permutation_importance (explaining how the model/pipeline makes predictions)
* Time series Analysis
* PCA and SVD

There are other exciting new topics like graph theory! 
* I already created and analyzed some networks.
* I worked with data in JSON format.
* I also worked with real data about connections between actors/actresses and directors.
* And I couldn't leave behind some interesting theory!

All the code is actively revised and I will be continuing to upload code here, so keep it tuned in!
